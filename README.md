# sprint-weather

A small script for a petty weather anaylisis.

A while back, a friend mentioned that it's always sunny on the first day of a sprint.
This script is an attempt to analyze the weather data to see if that's true.

- virtualenv

## Installation

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you're in the virtual environment before running the script.

## Usage
